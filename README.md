This repository provides an implementation of the HITSnDIFFS approach proposed in the ICDE 2024 paper *"HITSNDIFFS: From Truth Discovery to Ability Discovery by Recovering Matrices with the Consecutive Ones Property"* [(arXiv:2401.00013 long version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00013) as well as implementations of competitors and corresponding experiments in the paper.

## Programming Language and Libraries
The source code is written in Python, tested on Python version 3.8 or 3.10.
Install all necessary packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, girth, func-timeout, jupyter) by 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methods (`methods/`)
All the methods are in the folder, including various implementations of HITSnDIFFs (`hitsndiffs.py`) and ABH (`spectral.py`), majority vote (`majority.py`), "True-Answer" baseline (`baseline.py`), HITS-based approaches (`hits.py`) and GRM-estimator using the girth package (`grm.py`).

## Experiments (`experiments/`)
All the experiments reported in the paper in the folder, including various accuracy and efficiency experiments (`experiment.py`) on synthetic datasets (generated by `synthetic.py`), experiments on real-world datasets (`multichoice.py`), experiments on simulated datasets which use realistic estimated parameters for data generation (`simulation.py`) and experiments to comapare HnD and ABH (`comparison.py`). Synthetic data and intermediate are also provided in subfolders.

## Datasets (`datasets/`)
This folder contains the six real-world datasets we used in the experiments. The datasets are originally from http://www.ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/en-research/li2017cikm and used in the CIKM paper "Hyper Questions: Unsupervised Targeting of a Few Experts in Crowdsourcing" of J. Li, Y. Baba and H. Kashima. We appreciate the sharing of the authors!

## Reproducibility
The experimental result can be reproduced by running the Jupyter notebook `figures.ipynb`. The loading indicator to be True/False indicates whether the notebook directly reads the executed experimental result or re-runs the experiment. Note that re-running each experiment on the synthetic datasets can take up to several hours.

Various intermediate results are provided including the generated synthetic data (`experiments/synthetic`), the user abilities returned by different approaches for each run of the experiments (`experiments/ability`), the experimental result (`experiments/result`) and all figures (`experiments/figures`).
